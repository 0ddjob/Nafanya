# Нафаня (Nafanya) ZX Spectrum Clone
The Нафаня is a late Soviet-era (1991) ZX Spectrum clone out of the Russian SFSR.<br>  
My Нафаня is serial no. 00872.<br>

My particular example has a nice, ceramic Z80 from DDR (East Germany) as well as a ceramic БМК (Basic Matrix Crystal, Soviet version of a ULA or Gate Array).<br>

It looked like the original, good quality capacitors were removed from my machine due to their precious-metal content.  They were substituted with poor quality replacements.  I, in turn, replaced them with better quality ones ... this greatly stabilised the RGB video output!  I also added a lot more decoupling capacitors - there was provision for them on the board but they were not installed.<br>

## [ROM](/ROM)
The ROM from my machine can be found in this repository.<br>

It has a pretty cool boot screen - I assume this is depicting the character "Нафаня" the computer is named after, a домовой (domovoy, or house spirit) from the Soviet animated film series "Домовёнок Кузя" (Domovyonok Kuzya, or "Kuzya the Little Domovoy") which is based on a children's book by Tatiana Aleksandrova.<br>

## [New Keyboard](/Nafanya_Keyboard)
The keyboard is not terribly good. Here is a re-designed one using tactile switches that should fit in the existing case.<br>

### Status
6-Apr-2025: Still being finalised. The switch positions are slightly off as you go from left to right.
