# Нафаня (Nafanya) ZX Spectrum Clone
The Нафаня is a late Soviet-era (1991) ZX Spectrum clone out of the Russian SFSR.<br>  
My Нафаня is serial no. 00872.<br>

My particular example has a nice, ceramic Z80 from DDR (East Germany) as well as a ceramic БМК (Basic Matrix Crystal, Soviet version of a ULA or Gate Array).<br>

The ROM from my machine can be found in this repository.

## [New Keyboard](/Nafanya_Keyboard)
The keyboard is not terribly good. Here is a re-designed one using tactile switches that should fit in the existing case.<br>

### Status
